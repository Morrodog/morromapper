# Morromapper
This project aims to create an interactive, continuously updated progress map for [Tamriel Rebuilt](https://www.tamriel-rebuilt.org/), a long-running mod project for [The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls_III:_Morrowind).

It's built using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/).
